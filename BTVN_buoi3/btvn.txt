     I would like to introduce a smart phone which I have just invented. Its name is TN. It definitely has a lot of things that are totally different from other products. The phone has a rectangular screen with a display size of 4,7 inches and a resolution of 1080*1500 pixels. The TN dimensions are 100*70*75mm. It weighs 250 grams. The phone connects with other smart devices via wifi and Bluetooth. It has 2 colors to choose: black and white. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The smart phone is compatible with Android 7.1 operating system. This devide has 6000 mAh battery so you can use this phone for 2 days without charging. TN's features are facial recognition, camera, water and dust resistance, and gyroscope. What makes the phone stand out is new Retina HD displays which can bring better cinematic experience to users. I think th√≠ devide will bring a revolution in the phone industry
